### Description

A library for finding the roots of continuous scalar functions of a single real variable.

### Compiling

### Usage Examples

### Notes

* Originally this was an idea for the Fortran [stdlib](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib). See: [#87: Optimization, Root finding, and Equation Solvers](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues/87). Eventually, it may be merged into the other one in one form or another.
